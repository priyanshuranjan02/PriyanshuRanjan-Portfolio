                I'm a passionate Computer Science student currently pursuing my B.Tech in AI/ML at VIT Bhopal. 
                My journey in technology began with a curiosity about how things work, which eventually led me 
                to explore the fascinating worlds of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development.

                When I'm not coding or studying, you'll find me exploring the financial markets as a trader, 
                combining my technical knowledge with market analysis. I believe in the power of technology 
                to solve real-world problems and I'm constantly working on projects that bridge the gap 
                between innovation and practical applications.

                I'm always eager to learn new technologies, collaborate on exciting projects, and contribute 
                to meaningful solutions that can make a positive impact. Let's build something amazing together!
